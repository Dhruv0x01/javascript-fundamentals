# JavaScript Fundamentals

This repository contains **topic-wise JavaScript examples** that I created while learning JavaScript fundamentals from tutorials and practice.

Each folder focuses on **one concept**, with a simple HTML / CSS / JavaScript demo to understand how that concept works in practice.

## Structure

Each topic folder typically contains:
- index.html – basic markup
- style.css – minimal styling (when needed)
- script.js – JavaScript logic for the topic

## Progress

01 - intro
02 - Variables and Data Types  
03 - Arithmetic operators
04 - Accepting user input 
05 - Type Conversion 
06 - Constants
07 - Math objects
08 - if statements 


(New topics are added as I continue learning.)

## Purpose of This Repository

- Practice JavaScript concepts through small examples  
- Build strong fundamentals before moving to projects  
- Maintain a structured learning log on GitHub  

## Notes

- These are **learning-focused examples**, not full projects  
- Code may be improved or refactored as my understanding grows  

---

 **Learning in public and improving consistently.**
